# Deno Boilerplate

This is a very basic Deno Boilerplate.

It does not much. The only goal is to not have to setup and created a basic setup.

**Feel free to open pull requests!**

## basic usage

This boilerplate uses "make" to run the Deno commands.
It is usually already installed on your Unix OS.

You can use the following commands:
- run:      executes the `index.ts`
- test:     runs the tests
- format:   formats all your files
- debug:    runs the debugger starting in the `index.ts`
- bundle:   bundles your project into a single file in `build/index`

## Simple logger pre-configured

In `src/log.ts` you can find a simple logger that is extendable.

## ToDo

- Overall extend the project
- Think about a better developer experience
- Think about a better folder structure
- Create a companion CLI tool
- Probably more...
